Initialization order:

1st - PKI:
- Delete the DB and create a new keystore with a key pair. From this key pair, create certificates to place in the client and server trust stores.
- Configure the pki.properties file

2nd - Server:
- Delete the DB and logs, create a trustore and keystore to store the new keypair which will be create using the PKI.
- Configure server.properties and, for the first time running, set "params_reset = true". This process may take a long time.

3rd - Client:
- Create the keystore and truststore.
- Configure the client.properties file.
